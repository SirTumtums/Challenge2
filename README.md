# Challenge2
Repo For Challenge 2 
This is a dual purpose project.
One purpose of this project is show that I have an understanding of the basics in HTML and CSS. Any Java or features beside those two are a plus. This project is also to help me learn of other tools that can be used via research.

The other is to showcase what I have in terms of skills and how far I've come in the field throughout the course as a person. It willl be an ever changing portfolio to shhow interested parties what I am or can be capable of.
